# Changelog

All notable changes to CloudScale Code Block are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.7.48] - 2026-04-05

### Added
- Code Block Settings: checkbox to show/hide the CS Monitor performance panel (saved via AJAX alongside theme settings; hides the panel for all users when unchecked)

## [1.7.36] - 2026-04-05

### Added
- CS Monitor: **Assets tab** — all enqueued JS and CSS files, attributed to plugin/theme/wp-core, with type filter and search
- CS Monitor: **Hooks tab** — top 50 WordPress hooks by cumulative execution time; sortable by count, total, or max time; search filter
- CS Monitor: **Object cache stats** card in Summary — hit rate, hit/miss counts, persistent cache detection (Redis/Memcache)
- CS Monitor: **Slowest Hooks** section in Summary — top 8 hooks by total time with bar chart
- CS Monitor: **Assets** summary card showing JS + CSS counts

## [1.7.25] - 2026-03-23

### Fixed
- `editor.js`: `onPasteCode` now handles both the toolbar Paste button and the browser's native paste event (Ctrl+V) — previously Ctrl+V completely bypassed `decodeClipboardText()`, meaning escape-sequence decoding never ran on keyboard pastes; textarea now has `onPaste` handler that calls `event.preventDefault()` and reads from `event.clipboardData` synchronously

## [1.7.24] - 2026-03-23

### Fixed
- `editor.js`: `decodeClipboardText()` replaced broken `JSON.parse` approach with direct regex-based decoding — `JSON.parse` was silently failing when `\u0022` decoded to `"` inside the JSON string, causing `\n` to be stored as literal `n` and `\u0022` to be stored as literal `u0022` in the database; now handles `\n`, `\t`, `\r`, `\\`, `\uXXXX`, and bare `uXXXX` correctly
- `editor.js`: Added `(attributes.content || '')` null guard on `.split('\n')` row calculation to prevent TypeError on null content
- `cs-code-block.php`: Removed `opacity:.5;pointer-events:none` inline styles from the Migrate All button — inline styles were never cleared when the button was re-enabled via JS, leaving it visually disabled
- `assets/cs-code-migrate.css`: Added `.cs-btn-orange:disabled` and `.cs-btn-primary:disabled` CSS rules to handle disabled state declaratively
- `cs-code-block.php`: Fixed `printf()` in `render_migrate_panel()` — outer format string was wrapped in `esc_html__()` while `%s` was replaced with raw HTML; outer string now uses `__()` with a `phpcs:ignore` annotation
- `blocks/code/block.json`: Synced `version` field from `1.7.18` to `1.7.23`

## [1.7.21] - 2026-03-22

### Fixed
- `readme.txt`: Reduced tags from 8 to 5 (WordPress.org enforces a maximum of 5)
- `readme.txt`: Shortened short description to 141 characters (WordPress.org maximum is 150)
- `readme.txt`: Updated `Requires at least` from 5.8 to 6.0 to match plugin header
- `cs-code-block.php`: Added `phpcs:ignore InputNotSanitized` on `$_POST['sql']` — validated via `is_safe_query()`, not a standard `sanitize_*()` call
- `cs-code-block.php`: Added `phpcs:ignore InputNotSanitized` on `$_POST['post_id']` reads in `ajax_preview()` and `ajax_migrate_single()` — sanitised via `(int)` cast
- `cs-convert.js`: Removed `onclick` attribute from JS-generated toast button; replaced with `addEventListener`
- `cs-code-block.js`: Added `.catch()` to `copyToClipboard()` promise chain — logs clipboard API rejection via `console.error()`
- `cs-admin-settings.js`: Added `console.error()` to settings save `.catch()` block

## [1.7.18] - 2026-03-13

### Security
- Hardened `is_safe_query()`: SQL queries containing semicolons are now rejected, preventing statement stacking
- Removed `$_REQUEST` fallback in SQL AJAX handler — only `$_POST` accepted
- Added `phpcs:ignore` annotations with rationale for all intentional `$wpdb` direct-query patterns

### Fixed
- Removed echoed `<style>` block from admin tools page — all styles now served via enqueued `cs-admin-tabs.css`
- Extracted inline `<script>` blocks from settings and SQL panels into enqueued JS files (`cs-admin-settings.js`, `cs-sql-editor.js`)
- Replaced dynamic `document.head.appendChild(style)` injection in block editor with `wp_add_inline_style()`
- Removed `console.warn()` and `console.log()` debug calls from `cs-convert.js`

### Added
- `uninstall.php` — removes `cs_code_default_theme` and `cs_code_theme_pair` options on plugin deletion
- `load_plugin_textdomain()` called on `init`; 48 user-facing strings wrapped with i18n functions across frontend and admin
- Full DocBlocks (`@since`, `@param`, `@return`) on all class methods and class definition
- `@package` and `@since` tags in plugin file header

### Changed
- `wp_ajax_cs_save_theme_setting` hook consolidated into `init()` alongside all other AJAX hooks
- `date()` replaced with `wp_date()` in migration scan to respect site timezone
- `block.json` version synced to plugin version

## [1.7.17]

### Added
- Copy button now shows a "Copy" label alongside the clipboard icon

### Changed
- CSS refactored for copy button styling

## [1.7.16]

### Fixed
- `build_migrate_block()` JSON encoding corrected: removed `JSON_UNESCAPED_UNICODE | JSON_UNESCAPED_SLASHES` flags that caused `<`, `>`, and quote characters to be stored as literal bytes, corrupting block attributes on subsequent Gutenberg saves

### Changed
- All enqueued assets now use `filemtime()` for cache busting
- Block editor toolbar improvements

## [1.7.15]

### Fixed
- Split `decode_migrated_content()` into two independent passes so the bare-`\n` newline fix always runs regardless of whether unicode escapes were already decoded in the database

## [1.7.14]

### Fixed
- `decode_migrated_content()` in `render_block()` decodes unicode escapes and bare newline separators left by the v1 migration bug, fixing display of affected code blocks without requiring database changes

## [1.7.13]

### Fixed
- Code Block Migrator now uses safe JSON encoding so special characters like `<`, `>`, and quotes are stored as proper unicode escapes in block comment attributes, preventing content corruption on subsequent Gutenberg saves

## [1.7.8]

### Added
- Copy, Paste, and Clear buttons to the block editor toolbar

## [1.7.6]

### Fixed
- White toolbar text for improved contrast
- UNDEFINED language badge no longer displayed
- Powered by CloudScale link added to block toolbar

## [1.7.3]

### Changed
- Admin CSS embedded inline for reliable rendering across all WordPress configurations
- Admin UI restyled to match the CloudScale plugin family: navy gradient banner, dark tab bar with orange active indicator, white card panels with coloured gradient section headers

## [1.7.0]

### Added
- 14 popular syntax colour themes: Atom One, GitHub, Monokai, Nord, Dracula, Tokyo Night, VS 2015/VS Code, Stack Overflow, Night Owl, Gruvbox, Solarized, Panda, Tomorrow Night, Shades of Purple
- Colour Theme selector in the settings panel
- HCL/Terraform and TOML to the language selector
- 14 new SQL quick queries organised into four groups: Health and Diagnostics, Content Summary, Bloat and Cleanup Checks, URL and Migration Helpers

### Changed
- Each theme loads its dark and light variant from the highlight.js CDN
- Toggle button switches between the dark and light variant of the chosen theme
- Frontend CSS refactored to use CSS custom properties for theme-agnostic styling
- Theme backgrounds and toolbar colours adapt automatically to the selected theme
- Enter key now runs the SQL query; Shift+Enter inserts a newline

## [1.6.0]

### Added
- Merged CloudScale SQL Command plugin into CloudScale Code Block
- Combined Tools page at Tools > CloudScale Code and SQL with tabbed interface
- AJAX save for theme settings (no page reload required)

### Removed
