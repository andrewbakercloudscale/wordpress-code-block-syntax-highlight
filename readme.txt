Syntax highlighted code block with 14 color themes, auto language detection, clipboard copy, dark/light toggle, migrator, and SQL query tool.

== Description ==

CloudScale DevTools is a lightweight, zero dependency Gutenberg block plugin that renders beautifully syntax highlighted code on your WordPress site using highlight.js. It includes a built in code block migrator to convert legacy WordPress code blocks in bulk, and a read only SQL query tool for database diagnostics.

= Features =

* Gutenberg block and [cs_code] shortcode for syntax highlighted code
* 14 popular color themes loaded from the highlight.js CDN: Atom One, GitHub, Monokai, Nord, Dracula, Tokyo Night, VS 2015 / VS Code, Stack Overflow, Night Owl, Gruvbox, Solarized, Panda, Tomorrow Night, Shades of Purple
* Dark and light mode toggle per block with site wide default
* Auto language detection for 30+ languages including Bash, Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Rust, PHP, SQL, and more
* One click clipboard copy button
* Optional line numbers toggle
* Language badge auto detection
* Custom title / filename label per block
* Code Block Migrator: scan posts for legacy core/code blocks and batch convert them
* SQL Command: read only query tool with quick queries for database health checks, content summaries, bloat diagnostics, table sizes, orphaned postmeta, expired transients, and URL migration helpers
* Admin UI styled to match the CloudScale plugin family

= Requirements =

* WordPress 5.8 or later
* PHP 7.4 or later
* MySQL 5.7 or MariaDB 10.3 or later (for SQL Command features)
* highlight.js 11.11.1 loaded from cdnjs CDN (no local files required)

== Installation ==

1. Upload the cs-code-block folder to /wp-content/plugins/
2. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress
3. Add a CloudScale DevTools block from the Gutenberg block inserter, or use the [cs_code] shortcode
4. Configure your preferred color theme and dark/light default under Tools > CloudScale DevTools

If you were previously using the standalone CloudScale SQL Command plugin, you can deactivate and delete it after activating this version. All SQL functionality is now built in.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I change the syntax color theme? =

Go to Tools > CloudScale Code Block. On the Code Migrator tab you will see the Code Block Settings panel at the top. Select your preferred color theme from the dropdown and click Save Settings. The change applies to all code blocks site wide.

= Can visitors toggle between dark and light mode? =

Yes. Every code block has a sun/moon toggle button in its toolbar. The toggle switches between the dark and light variant of your chosen color theme. You set the site wide default (dark or light) in the settings, but visitors can override it per block.

= What languages are supported? =

The plugin uses highlight.js with auto detection. It supports over 30 languages out of the box including Bash, Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, C, C++, C#, Go, Rust, Ruby, PHP, Swift, Kotlin, SQL, JSON, YAML, XML, HTML, CSS, SCSS, Markdown, Makefile, Dockerfile, Lua, Perl, R, INI, TOML, Diff, GraphQL, HCL/Terraform, Objective C, and VB.NET. You can also set the language explicitly per block in the Gutenberg sidebar.

= Is the SQL Command tool safe? =

Yes. The SQL Command tool only allows SELECT, SHOW, DESCRIBE, and EXPLAIN queries. All write operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, DROP, ALTER, TRUNCATE, etc.) are blocked. It requires the manage_options capability so only administrators can access it.

= What are the quick queries in the SQL tool? =

The SQL tab includes 14 preset quick queries organized into four groups: Health and Diagnostics (database health check, site identity options, table sizes and rows), Content Summary (posts by type and status, site stats summary, latest published posts), Bloat and Cleanup Checks (orphaned postmeta, expired transients, revisions/drafts/trash, largest autoloaded options), and URL and Migration Helpers (HTTP references, posts with HTTP GUIDs, old IP references, posts missing meta descriptions).

= Can I run the query by pressing Enter? =

Yes. Press Enter to run the query. Use Shift+Enter to insert a newline. Ctrl+Enter also runs the query.

== Screenshots ==

2. Admin Tools page with the Code Block Settings panel and Code Block Migrator
3. SQL Command tab with query editor, results table, and quick query buttons

= 1.7.35 =
* Fixed: decodeClipboardText() in editor.js now correctly handles \n, \t, \r, \\, and \uXXXX escape sequences — previously JSON.parse failed silently when \u0022 decoded to " inside the string, storing literal n and u0022 in the database instead of newlines and double-quotes
* Fixed: null guard added to attributes.content.split() in editor.js to prevent a TypeError if content is null
* Fixed: migrateAllBtn inline opacity/pointer-events styles removed from PHP HTML — they were never cleared when the button was re-enabled; disabled state now handled via CSS :disabled selector
* Fixed: printf format string in render_migrate_panel() no longer uses esc_html__() on the outer string when HTML is injected via %s placeholder

= 1.7.20 =
* Security: is_safe_query() now rejects queries containing semicolons, preventing statement stacking
* Security: Removed $_REQUEST fallback in SQL AJAX handler
* Fixed: Echoed <style> block removed from admin page; inline <script> blocks extracted to enqueued JS files (PCP compliance)

* Added: filemtime() cache busting for all enqueued assets
* Improved: block editor toolbar enhancements

= 1.7.15 =
* Fix: split decode_migrated_content() into two independent passes so the bare-n newline fix always runs regardless of whether unicode escapes were already decoded in the database.

= 1.7.14 =
* Fix: decode_migrated_content() in render_block() decodes unicode escapes and bare newline separators left by the v1 migration bug, fixing display of affected code blocks without requiring database changes.

= 1.7.13 =
* Fixed: Code Block Migrator now uses safe JSON encoding so special characters like <, >, and quotes are stored as proper unicode escapes in block comment attributes, preventing content corruption on subsequent Gutenberg saves
